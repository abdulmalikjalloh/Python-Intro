# A tuple is ordered and immutable in nature, although duplicate entries  can be inside a tuple.
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second 
# item has index [1] etc..

tpl1 = (40,12,34,20) # declare a tuple with round brackets and assign four vaues to the tuple
bool1 = True
tpl2 = ( 410,132,4,2, "Amy", "Orange", bool1, 12.6)

print(tpl2)
print(tpl2.index("Orange")) # use the value to pint the index value/position
print(tpl2[4]) # use the index to print the value

# Exercise
# create a set 
# update the set 
# prevent the set from been updated
