# Python-Intro
I have a very strong passion for all things tech. Therefore, I am going to start documenting and sharing my little knowledge of coding python programming language, starting with the basics.

# What is Python?
Python is a programming language.

# What is programming and/or a program?
Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute
A program is a set of instructions.

# What is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that performs I.P.O
I.P.O ---> Input Process Ouput
For this reason (IPO), I beleive the term computing devices is best suited to describe electronic devices as it covers a wide range of electronic devices (Smart Watch, Sat Nav, Tablet, Mobile Phones..etc) that perfroms input process and output.

# Sorry for that detour, back to instructions. 
Humans carry out instructions daily, remember as a child, more often than you would have liked, you were instructed by your parents/guardians "It's time to go to bed". Only, with python we are instructing a computer(computing device) instead of another person, 
to do things or you can say. A programmer write some instructions in python programming language for the computer(computing device) to carryout/execute.  However, there is a way these instructions have to be written for it to be executed succssfully or rules(syntax) that we have to follow when writing instructions in python or to put more aptly when programming in python.

# Syntax you say
As with every culture and society there are rules(written/unwritten.). The rules that govern the way we communicate with each other. 
For example, when we extend and/or exchange greetings with people, be it family, friends or strangers, we follow some sort of rule(s). Granted when interacting with family members, loved ones or friends the rules are less stringent as opposed to an interaction with a stranger or someone you know in a profesional capacity.

# It is important to note that, these instructions could be in any programming language, 
and that these rules are specific to a programming language. Since python is the program of choice, it only makes sense it is reference specifically. Suffice to say "Syntax" in this instance are the rules specific to python programming language, in other words the spelling and grammar. Below are some python syntax examples:
# Python Syntax
 -Colon :
 -Semi Colon ;
 -Parenthesis ()
 -Quotation "" or ''
 -Question Marks ???
 -Forward/Backlash / or \S
 -Pipe(or in english) ||
 -Other characters *, &, % $, #, !, +, = 

There is a saying that, computers are dumb. Therefore, when writing programs in python, if we don't follow the syntax of python programming language, we get syntax errors. The computer will not try to correct our syntax, rather expecting the programmer to use the correct syntax when writing code:
1. Sequence 
   - Variables
    - What is a variable
    - Declare, initialiase, make a refernce call to a variable
    - Need for variable
   - Data types
2. Selection
3. Iteration
