# Python-Intro

I have a very strong passion for all things tech. Therefore, as python is one of my passion in tech, I will be documenting and sharing my knowledge of coding in python programming language, starting with the basics.

# What is Python?

Python is a programming language.

# What is programming and/or a program?

- Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute.

- A program is a set of instructions.

# What is a computer?

A computer is an electronic device that performs I.P.O.

- I.P.O ---> Input Process Ouput.
  For this reason (IPO) and in my opinion, I believe the term computing devices is best suited to describe electronic devices as it covers a wide range of electronic devices (Smart Watch, Sat Nav, Tablet, Mobile Phones..etc) that perfroms input process and output.

# Sorry for that detour, back to instructions.

Humans carry out instructions daily, remember as a child, more often than you would have liked, you were instructed by your parents or guardians "It's time to go to bed". Only, with python, we are instructing a computer(computing device) instead of another person to do things. Thus, A programmer write some (code) instructions in python programming language for the computer(computing device) to carryout or execute. However, there is a way these instructions have to be written for it to be executed succssfully or rules(syntax) that we have to follow when writing instructions in python or to put more aptly when programming in python.

# Syntax

As with every culture and society there are rules(written/unwritten.), the rules that govern the way we communicate with each other. For example, when we extend and/or exchange greetings with people, be it family, friends or strangers, we follow some sort of rule(s). Granted that when interacting with family members, loved ones or friends, these rules are less stringent as opposed to an interaction with a stranger or someone you know in a profesional capacity.

# An important note

It is important to note that, these instructions could be in any programming language, and that these rules(syntax) are specific to a programming language. Since python is the program of choice, it only makes sense it is reference specifically. Suffice to say "Syntax" in this instance are the rules specific to python programming language, in other words the spelling and grammar. Below are some python syntax examples:

# Python Syntax

- Colon :
- Semi Colon ;
- Parenthesis ()
- Quotation "" or ''
- Question Marks ???
- Forward/Backlash / or \S
- Pipe(or in english) ||
- Other characters \*, &, % $, #, !, +, =
- print("Hello World!")

# IDEs / Code Editors

Integrated development environment, makes it easier for programmers to write code, run code and debug(find errors) in different promgramming language. IDEs provide useful features such as; syntax higlighting (syntax structures), colour coding, auto complete lines of code using intellisense and even automatically indent your code. And indentation is very important when you write your code in python, and would lead to an indentation error if a line/block of code is not properly indented. Below is list of three IDEs and three code editors;

- Eclipse
- Netbeans
- Pycharm
- VSCode
- Sublime
- Atom

# Interpreter

Python is an interpreted programming language, thus use an interpreter to translate the code(instructions) written by programmers into a machine (code) readable format. When programmers write code, it is written in high level language(Python is an example of such language) and as computers can only executes machine code, thats why translator is required.

There is a saying that, computers are dumb. Therefore, when writing programs in python, if we don't follow the syntax of python programming language, we get syntax errors. The computer will not try to correct our syntax, rather expecting the programmer to use the correct syntax when writing code:

1. Sequence

- In python programming sequence is instructions perfromed or executed in the order in which they were written. Therefore, it is important to write the code in the correct sequence so that the predicted out matches the expected outcome, since the order of execution is from top to bottom.

- Variables and naming conventions
  - What is a variable
  - Declare, initialiase, make a refernce call to a variable
  - Need for variable
  - Data types

2. Selection
3. Iteration
