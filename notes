# What is Python?
Python is a programming language
# What is programming and/or a program?
Programming is writing instructions for a computer to execute
A program is a set of instructions.
# What is a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that performs I.P.O
I.P.O ---> Input Process Ouput
For this reason (IPO), I beleive the term computing devices 
is best suited to describe electronic devices as it covers a wide range of electronic devices
(Smart Watch, Sat Nav, Tablet, Mobile Phones..etc) that perfroms
input process and output.
Sorry for that detour, back to instructions. 
# Humans carry out instructions daily, 
remember as a child, more often than you would have liked, 
you were instructed by your parents/guardians "It's time to go to bed"
Only, with python we are instructing a computer(computing device) instead of another person, 
to do things or you can say. A human write some instructions in python for the computer(computing device) to carryout/execute.
However, there is a way in which we write these instructions or rules(syntax) that we have to follow when writing
instructions in python or to put more aptly when programming in python.

# Syntax you say, as with every culture and society there are rules(written/unwritten.) 
that govern the way we communicate with each other.
When we extend and/or exhange greetings to other people, be it family, friends or 
strangers. We have to follow these rules, granted when interacting with family members, 
loved ones or friends the rules are less stringent 
as opposed to an interaction with a stranger or someone you know in a profesional capacity.

# It is important to note that, these instructions could be in any programming language, and that 
these rules are specific to a programming language.
Since python is the program of choice, it only makes sense it reference specifically.
Suffice to say "Syntax" in this instance are the rules specific to python programming language, 
in other words the spelling and grammars. Below are some python syntax example:
Python Syntax
 -Colon :
 -Semi Colon ;
 -Parenthesis ()
 -Quotation "" or ''
 -Question Marks ???
 -Forward/Backlash / or \S
 -Pipe(or in english) ||
 -Other characters *, &, % $, #, !, +, = 


There is a saying that, computers are dumb. Therefore, when writing programs in python, 
if we don't follow the syntax of python programming language, we get syntax errors. The computer will
not try to correct our syntax because it the programmer's job to use the correct syntax.

# Now lets start writing code, using the three tenets of programmming as shown below:
1. Sequence : 
2. Selection
3. Iteration
